There once was a Bratwurst salesman in Berlin, who took his horse in the Hauptstrasse. 
He rode his horse down the Hauptstrasse all the way to th Biergarten. 
Looking to his right, he saw two very wettbewerbsfaehig men drinking what looked like their 12th drink each.
The Bratwurst salesman thought to himself,
    "These men must be from Berlin, they are sehr wettbewerbsfaehig drinkers. But I am the better drinker".
And so the Bratwurst salesamn drank himself silly, and ended up crashing into a waitress holding several Gebaecks.
Poor waitress. After all of the Brot and Apfelkuchen she made from her Baeckrei, this man just crashes on her and wastes all of her efforts.
She was so mad that her dirndl was ruined, she pushed him into the baeckerei and put a schloss on the door.
